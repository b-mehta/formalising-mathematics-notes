-- ## Practicing with the `rw` tactic
-- Let's get some practice with the `rw` tactic for equalities now.

example (a b c : ℝ) : a * b * c = b * (a * c) := by
  rw [mul_comm a b]
  rw [mul_assoc b a c]

-- Try these using rw.
example (a b c : ℝ) : c * b * a = b * (a * c) := by
  rw [mul_comm c b, mul_assoc, mul_comm c a]

-- Don't forget you can use ← to rewrite in the reverse direction!
example (a b c : ℝ) : a * (b * c) = b * (a * c) := by
  rw [← mul_assoc, mul_comm a b, mul_assoc]

-- An example.
example (a b c : ℝ) : a * b * c = b * c * a := by
  rw [mul_assoc]
  rw [mul_comm]

/- Try doing the first of these without providing any arguments at all,
   and the second with only one argument. -/
example (a b c : ℝ) : a * (b * c) = b * (c * a) := by
  rw [mul_comm, mul_assoc]

example (a b c : ℝ) : a * (b * c) = b * (a * c) := by
  rw [← mul_assoc, ← mul_assoc, mul_comm a]

-- Using facts from the local context.
example (a b c d e f : ℝ) (h : a * b = c * d) (h' : e = f) : a * (b * e) = c * (d * f) := by
  rw [h']
  rw [← mul_assoc]
  rw [h]
  rw [mul_assoc]

example (a b c d e f : ℝ) (h : b * c = e * f) : a * b * c * d = a * e * f * d := by
  rw [mul_assoc a, h, ← mul_assoc]

-- The lemma `sub_self` could be helpful
example (a b c d : ℝ) (hyp : c = b * a - d) (hyp' : d = a * b) : c = 0 := by
  rw [hyp, hyp', mul_comm, sub_self]

example (a b c d e f : ℝ) (h : a * b = c * d) (h' : e = f) : a * (b * e) = c * (d * f) := by
  rw [h', ← mul_assoc, h, mul_assoc]

-- Instead of having to declare my six real numbers each time, I can say `variables` which will

-- For instance, you can start your proof by sketching the structure as follows, with the sorry
